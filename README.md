# BacteriaCommunityEcoEvoModel
Code from Barraclough 2019 "Species matter for predicting the functioning of evolving microbial communities â€“ an eco-evolutionary model". https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/666685v1
The code is written in R and suitable for running either locally or within a high performance computing framework.

The basic model is set up to run a system with 4 species and 5 substrates, chosen to demonstrate how a pathway with linear steps, branching and converging steps can be specified. It does a single run and plots out enzyme allocations, species densities and substrate concentrations to a folder named with the current time. It comes in three files: run.basic.model.R is the file with parameter set up and that calls the model to run and plots it at the end, it includes annotations to explain what each part does; main.v4.R contains functions for the model and is sourced by run.basic.model.R; plot.model.R has code for making the plots and is sourced by run.basic.model.R. Download all 3 files into a folder, set the working directory in R, and then paste in code from run.basic.model.R to run the model. 

Code to run the simplified gut model described in the manuscript is also provided, in a file containing all functions suitable for submitting to a high performance computing cluster. It is recommended that users start with this basic model and familiarise themselves with adjusting the set-up in there before attempting to run the more complex model.
